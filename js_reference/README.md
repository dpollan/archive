# js_reference
This repository contains examples of implementations for several common data structures and algorithms.  It is a reference resource and can be used to quickly review how to create a given structure or implement a well known algorithm.  Unlike most public repo code where comments are limited inn the interest of brevity, I've tried to make gratuitous use of comments explaining exactly what is happening at each stage.  I wanted to make this a learning resource as well as something I personally can reference as the need arises.  Something where I can quickly review how something works to jog my memory of a concept learned long ago.  I do not recommend copy/pasting the code but rather use it as a guide or reference for creating similar data structures and algorithms in your own work.
