    <p>Project Start Date: 4/18/19</p>
    <p>Last Updated:       4/18/19</p>
    <h3>W.I.P.  The intended finished project will have links to several different data structures and will display the data contents and possibly a simple visualization to accompany it.  There will also be a link to the source code for each item.</h3>
    <p>For now, this html page allows the user to test javascript implementations of thier data structures in the browser console.  By simply editing this page and including a script tag with the designated data_structure.js file, the user can access these structures and ensure they work without issue. </p>
