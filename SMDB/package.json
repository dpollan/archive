  "description": "Simple Movie DataBase - Just your basic movie database that tracks only Movies, Actors and Directors. I chose SMDB because it creates all the relational database scenarios (Movies have one director, a director may have many movies, Actors will star in many movies and a movie will be starred in by many actors). The application will initially use the MERN stack but will have forks where the code has been refactored to use other frameworks.",
